Mini Ludum Dare #44: 7dRTS
================

A repository for [Mini Ludum Dare #44: 7 day RTS!][1] 

This is a real-time strategy game created in 7 days, with a focus on experimental gameplay concepts.

The goal of this project is to see how viable a real-time strategy game could be when the primary focus is from the first-person point of view, rather than from the point of view of a camera in the sky.

Use
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to test to make sure your changes are working, you need the latest version of the [Unity][2] engine. This is running in Unity Indie 4.2, which is available for free.

Clone/extract this repository to a place where you can freely access it, if you haven't already. Once Unity is installed, open it, choose `Open Project`, and navigate to the directory this README is stored in.

It should take some time to import all the assets and generate the metadata that goes along with them. Once it's finished however, you should test to make sure everything's working.

To do this, navigate in Unity to `Assets/Scenes` and open `Test.unity`. Once the scene is open, click on the light-grey "Play" button. It should turn dark grey and the Unity window should darken.

After a moment, the play and pause icons should turn bright blue, indicating that the game has been built successfully.
