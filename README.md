ludum-dare-7dRTS
================

A repository for Mini Ludum Dare #44: 7 day RTS! This is a real-time strategy game created in 7 days. The goal of this project is to see how viable a real-time strategy game could be when the primary focus is from the first-person point of view, rather than from the point of view of a camera in the sky.
